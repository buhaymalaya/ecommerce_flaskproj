This assignment will be a culmination of everything we’ve learned this week about Flask, Python.

Build an e-commerce application with the following things to be included:

X - A route that shows a list of all available products
X - A route which shows a single product (with the information of the product you just requested)
X - User should be able to add a product to their cart, but only if they are logged in
X - A route (cart) that shows a list of products you’ve added into your cart as well as the total of all the items in your cart
X - Add a route that, when called handles functionality that removes all items from your cart one time. Also a route, when hit, it removes a specific product object from the cart.
X - Create db Models for user, cart and products.

Extra Challenges:
X - Incorporate schemas for data validation and serialization
- Enhance your responses with nested schemas
X - Group your routes into classes using MethodViews
- Specify all your response status codes
